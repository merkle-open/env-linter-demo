# env-linter-demo

This repository helps to perform a short demo or smoke-test of the [env-linter](https://github.com/namics/env-linter). This can be especially useful before a release is being performed. Find out more in the [contribution guidelines of the env-linter](https://github.com/namics/env-linter/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTE.md).

This demo project is very simple, all it does is using a locally build version of the env-linter. Make sure to place the **env-linter-demo** directory next to the **env-linter** directory or adjust the path (`../env-linter/bin/index.js`) in the package.json accordingly.

Run `npm start` to see the env-linter in action. âœ…
